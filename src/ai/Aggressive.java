/**
 * Minmaxing AI that works on the opponent's piece count alone. This is actually very weak and tends to commit
 * suicide early on because it doesn't consider the safety of its own pieces. If you allow it to play a few
 * turns so that it doesn't kill itself, it becomes more powerful. Increasing the search depth also works, but
 * slows down the play considerably. A good first exercise is to modify this AI so that it doesn't kill itself on
 * low depth.
